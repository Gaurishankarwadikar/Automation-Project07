# Ecommerce Automation

This is a complete project where an E-commerce site is automated by writing test cases using selenium-webdriver and TestNg as testing framework.

The following key modules/pages are automated:
+ SignUp
+ Login
+ Search
+ Cart
+ Checkout

A state-transition flow of test-cases are designed and run like a user buying a product from an e-commerce site.
For failed test cases it will take a screenshot aswell at the point of failure.

### Technology:

+ Tool: Selenium Webdriver
+ IDE: Eclipse
+ Language: Java
+ Testing Framework : TestNG
